  title: About Crispy

<p>Here's an example of a static page where you can put all the lovely details about your site (not all pages have to be blog posts). In fact don't stop there! Just drop an html file anywhere in your source tree with some yaml front matter and Crispy will automatically render it for you with the site's default template.</p>
<p>While we're on the subject, you can also include static (like actually static) resources anywhere in your source tree (except for directories prefaced with an underscore "_") and Crispy will move them to the public directory for you totally untouched. So css/demo.css in your source tree will automatically become css/demo.css in your output directory. No build files or lists of inputs necessary! Crispy automagically finds everything!</p>
